# IsEven() and IsOdd()

`Bit-Wise Operations To Make The World a Bit Better`

These functions use bitwise "and" instead of modulus to check whether an integer is even or odd for maximum efficiency. To 
my knowledge, this should be the fastest way to determine whether a number is even or odd. I got this idea while working on my 
Tic-Tac-Toe in Assembly program and thought it was pretty cool. I would imagine I am nowhere near the first to have thought of 
this, but I thought it was worth sharing either way.
