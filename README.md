# SmallStuff

AUTHOR: Thomas Conner, student at the University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX

DESCIPTION: This is a repository for small assignments and projects I've made that don't 
warrant an entire repository for each project. Some of these programs may be functions, 
classes, or entire projects. The contents of this folder are often very similar to the type 
of programs I have written as part of technical interviews for jobs.

IMPORTANT: This folder acts solely as a portfolio. I DO NOT condone academic dishonesty. 
DO NOT copy any code for a High School or University project. If you want to use my code 
as inspiration, go for it, but please DO NOT copy and paste my code.
