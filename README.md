`It's Not the Size of the Program that Matters, it's How it's Implemented`

### Author
Thomas Conner, student at the University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX

### Description
This is a repository for small assignments and projects I've made that don't 
warrant an entire repository for each project. Some of these programs may be functions, 
classes, or entire projects. The contents of this folder are often very similar to the type 
of programs I have written in technical interviews. The time it took to write these programs
may be between 5 minutes and 2 hours, but are all alike in that I thought they  demonstrated 
some sort of ability relavent to computer science, and they were too small to warrant
putting them into their own repository or project page.

## Important
This folder acts solely as a portfolio. I DO NOT condone academic dishonesty. 
DO NOT copy any code for a High School or University project. If you want to use my code 
as inspiration go for it, but DO NOT copy and paste my code if you are a student.
