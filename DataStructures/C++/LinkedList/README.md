Generic Linked List class written in C++

Just to prove I can write one

This was written after 3 months of not using much C/C++ and instead using java.
If memory is not managed correctly in this, PLEASE tell me. I feel this is
sufficient in its current build, but if you see a flaw, PRETTY PLEASE tell me.
