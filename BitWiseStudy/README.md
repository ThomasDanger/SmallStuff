# Bit-Wise Study: A Study of Bit-Wise Operations

This is a folder dedicated to studying and practicing using bit-wise operations to provide novel solutions to simple/easy/beginner problems to optimize program performance. To my knowledge, they are one of the most efficient operations in programming as a whole. While programs like IsNegative() might not be any more efficient than the standard way to determining whether an integer is negative, my code in functions such as isOdd() and isEven() are faster than the more well-known alternative of using modulus. Much of this code (or all of it) might be common knowledge, but I think it will be fun to better my abilities when using bit-wise operations. With that said, almost all of this is useless, and as most people on stack overflow point out when you ask about bit-wise operations, you would probably not be using java if you valued performance that highly.

This idea came to me after writing my Tic-Tac-Toe in assembly program in which I used bit-wise operations on an integer to allow a user to play tic-tac-toe against an unbeatable CPU.
