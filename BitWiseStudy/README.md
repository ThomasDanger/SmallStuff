# Bit-Wise Study: A Study of Bit-Wise Operations

`Bit-Wise Operations Make The World a Bit Better`

This is a folder dedicated to studying and practicing using bit-wise operations to provide novel solutions to simple/easy/beginner problems to optimize program performance. To my knowledge, they are one of the most efficient operations in programming as a whole. While programs like IsNegative() might not be any more efficient than the standard way to determining whether an integer is negative, my code in functions such as isOdd() and isEven() are certainly better than the more well-known alternative of using modulus. Much of this code (or all of it) might be common knowledge, but I think it will be fun to better my abilities when using bit-wise functions.

This idea came to me after writing my Tic-Tac-Toe in assembly program. In that program's README, I chalked up my obession with writing the program to a newfound love for assembly languge, but now I am considering that I just really ike bit-wise operations.
